# MDMPOTATO
First bootstrap website made with [Khari](https://github.com/kharileigh) selling custom jacket potato meal kits. This website includes separate pages for mission statement, recipes and a cart system. It is fully responsive on desktop and mobile.

## Brief
We received a brief from Jagan, our Engineering instructor to create a website about our favourite food:

Choose your favourite food.

- Create a website using a CSS framework of your choosing
- Your website should include three pages
- A homepage
- A list of ingredients in your favourite food or a recipe to make it
- Places you can eat or purchase your favourite food.
- Your website should have:
- A navigation bar so that we can change page
- Buttons so that we can navigate to other pages by clicking on them
- Deploy your website

## Planning
Khari and I decided to plan out our website on pen and paper first.
